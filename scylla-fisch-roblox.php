                <h2 id="how-to-reach-veil-of-the-forsaken">How to Reach Veil of the Forsaken: the location where it is found</h2>
                <p>To access Veil of the Forsaken, <strong>you will need to complete a series of puzzles that begin in the Calm Zone</strong>.</p>
                <p>To access the first puzzle, you must locate the cave opening at the end of the Rainbow River.</p>
                <p>Upon entering the cave, you will encounter an obby consisting of floating platforms, which will fall after being stepped on for a certain amount of time. Once you complete it, you will reach a room containing a door.</p>
                <img style="width: 100%;margin-top:10px;" src="images/fisch/calm-zone-puzzle.jpg" alt="Calm Zone Puzzle in Fisch">
                <p>To open the door, <strong>it is necessary to obtain three <span class="exotic">exotic</span> fish</strong> that can be caught in Mariana's Veil:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frozen Leviathan ×1 from the Challenger's Deep</li>
                    <li>Crowned Anglerfish ×1 from the Abyssal Zenith</li>
                    <li>Magma Leviathan ×1 from the Volcanic Vents</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The door will remain open even if you leave the game.</p>
                <p>Once the three fish are placed in their respective slots, the door will open and you will be able to access the Calm Zone fish.</p>
                <p>If you continue beyond the Calm Zone, you will find a large puzzle with four Scylla heads. When solved, it opens a large hatch that serves as the entrance to Veil of the Forsaken.</p>
                <img style="width: 100%;margin-top:10px;" src="images/fisch/chessboard-puzzle-scylla.jpg" alt="Chessboard Puzzle Scylla in Fisch">
                <p>To solve the puzzle, all four heads must be moved to the correct position.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each statue starts at the beginning of the line.</li>
                    <li>Each statue has a random "correct position" every time the puzzle starts.</li>
                    <li>Pushing a statue from behind moves it forward, and pushing it from the front moves it backward.</li>
                    <li>When a statue is in the correct position, it will light up green.</li>
                    <li>The player has one minute from the moment the first statue is moved to place all four statues correctly.</li>
                    <li>If the player is too slow, the puzzle will reset and go on cooldown for a few minutes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="scylla-boss-fight">Scylla Boss Fight</h2>
                <p>Jumping through the door will teleport you to a waiting room where you must wait for the fight against Scylla to begin. <strong>Multiple players can jump in and participate in the fight</strong>.</p>
                <p>Scylla has four heads, which fire different fireballs at the player during the battle. If the player is hit by four of Scylla’s fireballs during the fight, they will die and respawn at the Chessboard Puzzle.</p>
                <p>During the battle, you must explore the Veil of the Forsaken map and collect the bow, arrow, and base of the crossbow. If you fall into the water, you will lose all the pieces in your inventory. Keep in mind that the boss fight lasts 10 minutes, and if you fail to complete it, you will have to try again.</p>
                <img style="width: 100%;margin-top:10px" src="images/fisch/scylla-boss-fight.jpg" alt="Scylla Boss Fight in Fisch">
                <p>All pieces must be returned to the large crossbow above the entrance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crossbow Base can be found on the north side of the chamber</li>
                    <li>Crossbow Bow can be found on the north-east side of the chamber</li>
                    <li>Crossbow Arrow can be found on the north-west side of the chamber</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you insert all three pieces into the crossbow, a cutscene will play in which Scylla is defeated and the battle ends.</p>
                <p>After finishing the battle, you will have permanent access to fishing in Veil of the Forsaken.</p>
   <h2 id="how-to-catch-scylla">How to catch Scylla in Fisch quickly and safely</h2>
                <p>Scylla can be caught in the Veil of the Forsaken, which is the fifth and final area of Mariana's Veil. Scylla Hunts last 15 minutes and <strong>can appear naturally at the start of both day and night</strong>, with a 2.5% chance.</p>

                <h3 id="how-to-spawn-scylla">How to spawn Scylla easily and quickly</h3>
                <p>To spawn Scylla easily and quickly, you can use Sundial Totems, which help you skip day and night cycles. You can also use Scylla Hunt Totems, which can be found in the Daily Shop in Moosewood and will help you spawn Scylla immediately.</p>

                <img style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10px;" src="images/fisch/scylla-hunt.jpg" alt="Scylla Hunt in Fisch">

                <p>To catch Scylla, <strong>it is highly recommended to use the Leviathan's Fang Rod</strong> to take advantage of its passives: +50% resilience and +4% progress speed while fishing. In addition, you can use this rod’s ability that allows the use of Steady/Blessed Song enchantments. I recommend using Aurora Totems to make the catch easier, giving you a 1.92% (1/52) chance to catch it, since without an Aurora Totem the catch rate is only 0.32% (1/313).</p>

                <h3 id="bait-for-scylla">Bait for Scylla</h3>
                <p>Scylla’s preferred bait is the Shark Head, which gives you a much higher chance of catching it.</p>

                <h2 id="scylla-value">Scylla Value</h2>
                <img style="width: 100%;" src="images/fisch/scylla.jpg" alt="Scylla in Fisch">

                <p>The base price of a Scylla is 44,238 C$, and it weighs around 500,000 kg. At maximum, it can reach a value of 92,900 C$ and a maximum weight of 1,050,000 kg.</p>
                <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
                <h3>Can I catch Scylla while another player is catching it?</h3>
                <p>Scylla cannot be lured while another player is catching it.</p>
